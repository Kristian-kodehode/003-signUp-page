# SIGNUP PAGE - html and css

This is one of the very first project i did in html and css.
One of the things i struggled with was the "hover animation" on the
character. I obviously maade it work in the end :)

From this project i learned to use animations and also the basics of
html inputs. It started to open my design-mind on how to use css.
